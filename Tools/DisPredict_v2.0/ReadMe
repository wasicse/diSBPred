DisPredict_v2.0
================
DisPredict is a predictor of disorder residues in protein. 
It takes protein sequence (standard FASTA format) as input
and outputs per residue binary annotation (disorder or order)
along with two real values corresponding to probability
of that residue being disorder and order. DisPredict2 includes 
position specific estimated energy as feature.

DisPredict2 is available at:
http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software/PSEE/PSEE.zip

Quick Run Guide
===============
	
1) SET input
	- Redirect into DisPredict_v2.0/Software/Input
	- Follow the instructions in "ReadMe_Input.txt" to complete "Raw_Data.txt" and "id_list.txt"
	
2) SET path variables within script 'run_DisPredict_v2.0'
	- Redirect into DisPredict_v2.0/Software/Scripts
	- SET path of PSI-BLAST (BLAST/bin) and NR database
	- SET path of installed SPINE-X
	- SET path of IUPred source codes
	- SET path of DAVAR (phi,psi fluctuation prediction software)
	- SET path of libSVM installation directory 
	
3) Run prediction
	- Redirect into DisPredict_v2.0/Software/Scripts	
	- Execute 'runDisPredict_v2.0'
		- ./runDisPredict_v2.0 (SET the permission if required)
	- Prediction outputs will be at "Output/prediction/"
		- 'id.dispredict2.sl477.predict' 
	- Final formatted (CASP-like) outputs will be at DisPredict2 subdirectory for each id
		- 'id.drp'		
		
Thanks!!
ENJOY!!		

How To Run DisPredict2
================

Prerequisite
============

1) PSI-BLAST with NR database (from NCBI toolkit) 
Availability > ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/
Output > PSSM

2) SPINE X (Install it in 'AdditionalFiles' directory of Software)
Availability > http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu/SPINE-X/
Installation > tar zxf spineXpublic.tgz
			 > ./compile
Output > secondary strucutre probabilities (helix, strand and coil)
		 accessible surface area and 
		 torsion angles (phi and psi) 
		 
3) IUPred (Installed in 'AdditionalFiles' directory of Software)
Availability > http://iupred.enzim.hu/
Output > prediction of intrinsically unstructured protein 
Note: 
	> The output (short disorder) is used for DAVAR -> phi, psi backbone torsion angle fluctuations prediction
	> This output is NOT used for DisPredict	

4) DAVAR (Installed in 'AdditionalFiles' directory of Software)
Reference: 
	> E. Faraggi et al., ``Improving the prediction accuracy of residue solvent 
	accessibility and real-value backbone torsion angles of proteins by fast guided-
	learning through a two-layer neural network.'', Proteins 74, 857-871 (2009)
	> contact @'yaoqi.zhou@griffith.edu.au' for the software
	
4) libSVM
Availability > http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm
Keep the binary files to execute "svm-scale" and "svm-predict" in the directory SuppMaterial_DisPredict/Software/Codes/

5) GCC
Availability > http://gcc.gnu.org/
The source codes are written in C/C++. To compile and execute, GCC is needed.

Input feature format
====================

For a protein sequence, following per residue features must be collected in space separated columns:

1) Column 1: binary class label
				- disorder: +1 and order: -1
				- for a test protein sequence, use dummy (+1/-1) class label		
2) Column 2: amino acid type
				- one numerical value out of 20
				-  (1, 2, 3, ..., 20) for (A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V)
3) Column 3 - 9: 7 physical parameters
					- available at SuppMaterial_DisPredict/Software/AdditionalFiles/Physical_Parameters.txt	

4) Column 10 - 29: 20 PSSMs
					- generate with PSI-BLAST and normalize using 9.0	
										
5) Column 30 - 32: 3 secondary structure (helix, strand and coil) probabilities
					- generate using SPINE X
					
6) Column 33: 1 accessible surface area
				- generate using SPINE X
					
7) Column 34 - 35: 2 torsion angle (phi and psi) fluctuations
				- generate using DAVAR 

8) Column 36 - 56: 1 monogram and 20 bigrams
				- generate using source code provided with DisPredict supplementary materials
				- available at SuppMaterial_DisPredict/Software/Source Codes
				- guidelines to execute it is described in "Steps to prediction" below
				- normalize the values with exponent (6.0)

9) Column 57: 1 Position Specific Estimated Energy (PSEE)
				
10) Column 58: 1 terminal indicator
				- 5 residues from N-terminal: -1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2
				- 5 residues from C-terminal: +1.0, +0.8, +0.6, +0.4, +0.2
				- rest: 0.0
