BalancedSSP
===========
BalancedSSP is a balanced high throughput secondary structure (SS) predictor 
which may achieve high overall accuracy as well as maintain good accuracies 
in all three SS components. For this, we proposed a novel approach using 
three different support vector machines (SVMs) for binary classification 
of the major classes: beta (E), coil (C) and helix (H), and then formed 
optimized multiclass predictor, called cSVM, using genetic algorithm (GA). 
The trained three binary SVMs are E versus non-E ( E/~E), C versus non-C (C/~C)
and H versus non-H (H/~H). cSVM is further combined with SPINE X to form the 
proposed final balanced predictor, MetaSSPred. The basic input is protein 
sequence in standard fasta format and the output is predicted secondary 
structure for each residue in the sequence.

Availability
============
BalancedSSP is available at:
http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software.html

Quick Run Guide
===============

1) SET input
	- Redirect into BalancedSSP/Software/Input
	- Follow the instructions in "ReadMe_Input.txt" to complete "id_list.txt"
	
2) SET path variables within script 'run_BalancedSSP'
	- Redirect into BalancedSSP/Software/Scripts
	- SET path of PSI-BLAST (BLAST/bin) and NR database
	- SET path of IUPred source codes (given within the software in AdditionalFiles directory)
	- SET path of libSVM installation directory 
	- SET path of DAVAR source codes (given within the software in AdditionalFiles directory)
	- SET path of SPINE-X source codes (given within the software in AdditionalFiles directory)
	
3) Run prediction
	- Redirect into BalancedSSP/Software/Scripts	
	- Execute 'run_BalancedSSP'
		- ./run_BalancedSSP (SET the permission if required)
	- Prediction outputs of secondary structure by cSVM will be at "Output/prediction/$id/cSVM"
		- 'id.cSVMpred'
	- Prediction outputs of secondary structure by MetaSSPred will be at "Output/prediction/$id/MetaSSpred"
		- 'id.MetaSSpred'		
For detail description of Software, users are requested to read 'ReadMe' in 'BalancedSSP' package.
		
Thanks!!
